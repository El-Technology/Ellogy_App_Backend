Participants: Declare participants using participant, actor, database, etc., affecting their representation (e.g., participant Participant as Person1). Self-Interaction: Participants can send messages to themselves (e.g., Person -> Person: Self Request). Grouping: Use alt/else, opt, loop, etc., to group messages, with the ability to nest groups (e.g., alt condition ... else ... end). Activation: Utilize activate and deactivate to denote participant activation, and destroy for the end of a participant's lifeline (e.g., Person1 -> Person2: Activate Person2).

Start/Stop: Use start and stop to denote the beginning and end of the diagram (e.g., start ... stop). Conditional Structures: Implement if, then, else, and elseif for conditional flows, with labels in parentheses (e.g., if (Condition?) then (yes) ... else (no) ... endif).
